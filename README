Content Description:
  bin/
    - This directory contains the executable file. It can be run directly on Windows OS if
      it's configured with OpenGL.

  data/
    subdividable_models/
      - This directory contains the model files that are dividable using loop subdivision.
    test_textures/
      - This directory contains the texture images used for testing.

  src/
    - This directory contains the files necessary for building the program if all external
      dependencies exist.

External Dependancies:
  1. OpenGL and its utility library.
  2. Simple OpenGL Imaging Library (SOIL).
  3. Windows platform (tested on Windows 7).

Glitches or Limitations:
  1. The program is MDI but it support only one MDI child window currently. Considering the
     load of 3D processing, I restrict only one model can be displayed and manipulated.
     Please don't close the MDI child window. If you close it, you cannot restart it inside
     the program and then you need to restart the program in order to get it back. I have
     considered disable the closing functionality of the child window but I failed to find
     out a solution after long struggling.
  2. Hiden toolbar buttons. If you maximize the program window, you will discover that the
     toolbar buttons are disappeared. They are still there, actually, but they are not
     displayed. If you click on them, they will show up again. I also tried many times to
     fix this problem but I really could not handle it.
  3. Restrictions on model files. The model files are required to be composed of triangluar
     meshes. In testing, all models using triangular meshes can be read and displayed.
     Hitherto, the program won't fill the holes in models. It can perform loop subdivision
     on models if the models have no singularity. The program is relatively robust in loop
     subdivision since it can handle the cases like: very large and detailed models, and
     models that are not closed (e.g. a single plane, a cube with some facets missing).
     Nevertheless, if the models contain singularity (e.g. more than two facets share the
     same edges), it won't be able to subdivide the model and it will freeze.
  4. Normals and texture coordinates are not considered in loop subdivision. Thus if you
     perform loop subdivision, you can only view the results in wired form.
  5. The program builds half-edge datastructure for incoming models and thus it can be very
     slow as the model files get too large.
  6. The program can only read .obj files currently.
  7. The path to the .obj file and the name of the file itself can contain ASCII characters.
     If the they contain non-ASCII characters, the program won't be able to read the file
     and it will freeze.

User Manual
  1. Open a model file
    Click the "File" tab on the menu bar and then click "Open" or use shortcut key.
    Navigate to the .obj file and choose it. Wait for the loading process to finish.
  2. Translate, rotate, or scale a model
    You need to open a model file before doing these. Click on the corresponding buttons on
    the toolbar. To translate or rotate models, hold left button and drag when the
    corresponding buttons are pressed. To scale, roll the mouse wheel when the scaling button
    is pressed.
  3. Loop subdivision
    Just click the corresponding button on the toolbar.
  4. Texturing
    Click the toolbar button with an uppercase letter T. Then, navigate to the texture image
    and choose it. Then model should have texture coordinates and normals for this to work.
  5. Lighting
    Click on the light bulb on the toolbar to enable or disable lighting.
  6. Exit
    You can either exit the program using the menu item under the "File" tab or the "x"
    button on the upper-right corner.
